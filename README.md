 A Real state application provides clients with data and information about properties available for sale or rent.  
 A virtual assistant, within the application, will aide the customer to search for the properties they desire to rent or buy. 
 They can also set filter to specific requirements they like to have in their properties. 
 In this application, a property can be owned, sold, rented or bought. 
 Customers can contact the owners of a property they displayed for sale or rent via email or phone call.
